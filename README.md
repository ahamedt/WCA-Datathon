LSTM Sales Predicting Model


The following file contains the code I used to develop 1) an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for the prediction of sales data and 2) A correlation heatmap of the various goods that were bought in conjunction with one another. Both of these formed a part of the recommender system that my team and I were developing for the company in the Wharton Consumer Analytics Datathon.
